### Features

- **http client:** allow empty baseUrl and not mandatory anymore
- **http client:** `HttpRequestMessage` are being disposed after sending
- **http client:** add better support for file uploads (from: path, stream, bytes) e.g.
```cs
var multiForm = new MultipartFormDataContent
{
  { "hero", "Jaina" }
};
multiForm.AddFile("file", "./animal-mustache.jpg");
httpClient.CreateRequest("/api/sample/upload")

### Features

- **logger middleware:** add condense mode which reduces clutter logs, add timings in responses. This might make a bit Timer logger a bit redundant, however log level thershold is not implemented. Unless its really needed removing `TimerMiddleware` from the pipeline it is suggested.
- **graphql:** add `OperationName`
- **graphql:** rename `GqlQuery` to `GqlRequest`
- **csharp:** initial nullability support

### Bug Fixes

## [3.5.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/3.4.0...3.5.0) (2019-09-03)

### Features

- **util:** add querystring option `WithValueFormatter` similar to `WithCollectionItemFormatter` to format each value e.g. enum formatter

### Deprecated code

- **util:** query options deprecate `CollectionItemFormatter` and `KeyFormatter` with `WithCollectionItemFormatter`, `WithKeyFormatter` instead of exposing func directly

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/3.0.0...3.0.1) (2019-04-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **headers:** `_data` was `public` now is set to `private` as intended

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/2.2.0...3.0.0) (2019-04-12)

Middleware has been reworked, its now much more efficient as it creates instances per middleware per client, instead of every request.

### Features

- **middleware:** middleware has been reworked, and now are much more efficient
- **middleware:** middleware now logs the identifier in source e.g. `FluentlyHttpClient.Middleware.sketch7.Timer`, given HttpClient identifier was `sketch7`,
  so logs can be more fine controlled
- **headers:** add `FluentHttpHeaders` since `HttpHeaders` (and all implementations) cannot create instances of, and changed all implementations to use it instead of `Dictionary<string, string>`
- **util:** add several extensions when working with `HttpHeaders`
- **http request:** now exposes the request builder
- **http request:** add request hash `FluentHttpRequest.GetHash`, `FluentHttpRequestBuilder.WithRequestHashOptions` which can be used to build an id hash for the request
- **request builder:** add `IFluentHttpMessageItems` which `FluentHttpRequestBuilder`, `FluentHttpRequest` and `FluentHttpResponse` implements, so items extension methods can target all
- **http client builder:** `WithBaseUrl` now accepts optional bool `replace` which will append to the existing. Useful when creating sub client to inherit and continue adding to it
- **response caching middleware:** implemented response caching middleware `UseResponseCaching` which the intention is not for performance improvements but more to proxy/mocking, as it copies responses and serve them if they were already requested.
  We also implemented remote caching which stores in database using EntityFramework see [FluentlyHttpClient.Entity](./src/FluentlyHttpClient.Entity/README.md). It can also be extended to implement custom stores e.g. we have another which is for Microsoft Orleans (not published - yet)

### Bug Fixes

- **http client:** fix `identifier` for sub client when using `CreateClient` was being replaced by the parent's instead of the one specified
- **http client builder:** fix an issue when base url doesn't contain a trailing `/` in certain cases it will trim last value e.g. http://myapi.com/v1 would result in http://myapi.com

### BREAKING CHANGES

Even though breaking changes are quite a lot, most of them are more internal

- **middleware:** `FluentHttpRequestDelegate` has been removed in favor of `FluentHttpMiddlewareDelegate`
- **middleware:** `IFluentHttpMiddlewareRunner` and `FluentHttpMiddlewareRunner` has been reworked
- **middleware:** `IFluentHttpMiddleware` changed from `Invoke(FluentHttpRequest)` to `Invoke(FluentHttpMiddlewareContext)`
- **middleware:** renamed `MiddlewareConfig` to `FluentHttpMiddlewareConfig` for consistency
- **http client builder:** `FluentHttpClientOptions` changed `List<MiddlewareConfig> Middleware` to `FluentHttpMiddlewareBuilder MiddlewareBuilder`
- **http client factory:** removed `Add(FluentHttpClientOptions)` from `IFluentHttpClientFactory` and moved it as an extension method
- **exceptions:** exceptions has been moved correctly to `FluentlyHttpClient` namespace
- **util:** querystrings now defaults to camel casing instead of lower casing
- **request builder:** `FluentHttpRequestBuilder.WithQueryParams(object, bool)` has been removed
- **request builder:** change headers from `Dictionary<string, string>` to `FluentHttpHeaders`
- **http client builder:** change options headers from `Dictionary<string, string>` to `FluentHttpHeaders`

See [these changes](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/pull/25/files#diff-efc205ab9587ec42db3de44d14c0ce86)
in order to help you update an existing middleware to the new version (fear not, changes are minimal :)).

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/2.1.2...2.2.0) (2019-03-03)

- **http client:** now able to create a new http client from an existing one and inheriting options with `CreateClient`
- **http client builder:** add `FromOptions` which gets configured via `FluentHttpClientOptions`
- **http client builder:** rename `Build` to `BuildOptions` and `Build` now returns the http client
- **http client builder:** `WithRequestBuilderDefaults` now will combine previous defaults instead of replacing them.
  If you want to replace the previous defaults (as it was working), use `WithRequestBuilderDefaults(..., replace: true)`.
  This behavior is changed because its more expected that they are combined, especially when creating a sub-client and adding/changing request defaults would loose the previous defaults from the creator (parent).
- **http client factory:** add overload `Add(IFluentHttpClient)`

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **http client builder:** `Build` has been renamed to `BuildOptions` and add `Build` which now returns an Http Client.
  _Most probably it won't affect anyone since its more for internal use_

  - `CollectionMode` - this will allow to configure collection items in querystrings as below:
    - `KeyPerValue` e.g. `"filter=assassin&filter=fighter"`
    - `CommaSeparated` e.g. `"filter=assassin,fighter"`
  - `CollectionItemFormatter` - Allows you to format item value e.g. take enum description value. (see tests)
  - `KeyFormatter` - Allows you to format key with via a custom function e.g. lowercase, camelCase, PascalCase and you can utilize other libraries such as [humanizer](http://humanizr.net/).

- **request builder:** now using the new querystring options `WithQueryParams(object queryParams, QueryStringOptions options)` (and similar with `Action`)
- **request builder:** `WithQueryParamsOptions(QueryStringOptions options)` (and similar with `Action`) which can be used nicer in conjuction with `WithRequestBuilderDefaults` as below:

```cs
clientBuilder.WithRequestBuilderDefaults(builder =>
  builder.WithQueryParamsOptions(opts =>
  {
    opts.CollectionMode = QueryStringCollectionMode.CommaSeparated;
    opts.KeyFormatter = key => key.ToUpper();
  })
);
```

### Deprecated code

- **request builder:** `WithQueryParams(object queryParams, bool lowerCaseQueryKeys)` has been marked as obsolete, instead the newly `WithQueryParams(object queryParams, Action<QueryStringOptions> configure)`.
