# Fluently Http Changelog

[*vNext*](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.4.1...1.4.2) (201X-X-X)

## [1.4.2](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.4.1...1.4.2) (2018-03-18)

### Features
 - **timer middleware:** now logs even when an exception is thrown, which might be useful when a timeout has triggered.
 - **timer middleware:** `SetTimeTaken` now returns `FluentHttpResponse` instead of `void`.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1) (2018-03-04)

### Bug Fixes
 - **request builder:** items within request/response e.g. time taken (from timer middleware) were updating the request builder items which 
 was causing susequent requests built by the same request builder to fail.
 - **http client builder:** `Withdentifier` has been renamed correctly to `WithIdentifier` previous one was marked as obsolete.

 ### Deprecated code

 - **http client builder:** `Withdentifier` has been marked as obsolete, instead the newly `WithIdentifier`.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.3.0...1.4.0) (2018-03-03)

### Features
 - **logger middleware:** add `LoggerHttpMiddlewareOptions` to configure `ShouldLogDetailedRequest` and `ShouldLogDetailedResponse`.
 - **logger middleware:** add `WithLoggingOptions` on request builder, to specify options per request.
 - **timer middleware:** add `WithTimerWarnThreshold` on request builder, to specify options per request.


## [1.3.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.2.1...1.3.0) (2018-02-24)

### Features
 - **http client builder:** add `ConfigureFormatters` which now able to configure `Default` formatter to be used.
 - **sample:** add sample for MessagePack formatter - see `MessagePackIntegrationTest` and `MessagePackMediaTypeFormatter`.

### Deprecated code

 - **http client builder:** `WithFormatters` has been marked as obsolete, instead the newly `ConfigureFormatters`.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.2.0...1.2.1) (2018-02-16)

### Bug Fixes
 - **regex extensions:** `ReplaceTokens` now validates object instead of throwing null reference exception.
 This now will give better errors when using interpolations without value.
 - **request builder:** `WithQueryParams` now omits query param when value is null instead of null reference exception.

### Deprecated code

 - **collection extensions:** `Set` has been marked as obsolete, as it can be replaced by 1 liner.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0) (2018-01-12)

### Features

 - **graphql:** add support for GraphQL to have simpler api's specifically for GraphQL. (thanks to [Kurt Cassar](https://github.com/nismolo) for contribution)
 - **consts:** add `XForwardedFor` in `HeaderTypes`.

New apis such as:
 - `fluentHttpClient.CreateGqlRequest(query)` - Creates a new HTTP request and configure for GraphQL.
 - `requestBuilder.AsGql(query)` - Configures an existing HTTP request builder as a GraphQL request.
 - `requestBuilder.ReturnAsGqlResponse<T>()` - Sends request and unwrap GraphQL data to be available directly in the `.Data`.

See documentation for an example on how it can be used.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0) (2017-07-02)

### Features

- **request builder:** implement `WithItem` which allows to set custom items that can be used to share data within the scope of request, response, and middleware.
- **request builder:** add `WithUserAgent` extension.
- **request builder:** add validation for request when 'GET' and has body content, to not be allowed. As it will blow up the underlying HttpClient.

- **request:** add `Formatters` which can be useful for middleware.
- **message state:** extract interface `IFluentHttpMessageState`, which both `FluentHttpRequest` and `FluentHttpResponse` implements.
This will allow sharing implementations for extensions methods across `FluentHttpRequest` and `FluentHttpResponse` related to `Items`.

- **header builder:** extract interface `IFluentHttpHeaderBuilder`, which both `FluentHttpClientBuilder` and `FluentHttpRequestBuilder` implements.
This will allow sharing implementations for extensions methods across `FluentHttpClientBuilder` and `FluentHttpRequestBuilder` related to `Headers`.

- **http client builder:** formatter JSON is now configured with camelcase property names by default.
- **http client builder:** now shares request builder headers extensions such as `WithUserAgent` and `WithBearerAuthentication`.
- **http client builder:** implement `ConfigureDefaults` which enables to configure defaults for newly created http clients.

- **logger middleware:** add extension method `UseLogging`.

- **consts:** add constants for headers and auth schemes `HeaderTypes` and `AuthSchemeTypes`


 ## [1.0.0](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/0.3.0...1.0.0) (2017-06-30)

### Features

 - **http client builder:** implement `WithFormatters` to be able to configure formatters.

 - **http client:** implement `IDisposable` in order to dispose underlying `HttpClient`.

 - **timer middleware:** add extension method `UseTimer` for convience.

### Code Refactoring

 - **request:** rename `Url` to `Uri`.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- `IFluentHttpResponse` has been removed and added `FluentHttpResponse` instead. In addition, most of `FluentHttpResponse<T>` method has been changed with `FluentHttpResponse`.
Most of the changes should only effect the internals, apart from middlewares.
